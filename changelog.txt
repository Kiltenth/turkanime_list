Add web scraping feature to get the name of the anime from html elements and add It to a txt file.

Version 0.1.1
--------------
-Noticed the connection problems and HTTP Error 403: Forbidden was due to website having different TLDs previously. Even though when a link with old TLD was used, user got redirected to up-to-date website; urllib was unable to connect. Using User-Agents made no difference.

A temporary or if no other solution is present a permanent way to fix this was to change older TLDs in the string with the current TLD of website.

Program is currently able to get the 'title' element from pages that are in a list, add titles to another list and print them.

To-Do 0.1.1
-------------
Previous 'To-Do's are still present. Titles will be extracted to a txt file.
